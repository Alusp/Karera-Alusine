    <p>Young Africans can use technology to compete on the global market? Yes.
      But tech in Africa is steel at law level, many people need to copy with tech and the process of doing that is too
      slow.
      I explained 5 key areas which are important to grow in order for Africans to strongly stand in global market
      competition
      which are: Education, health, agriculture, construction, and computer programming.
      If we manage to stay strong and competitive in those areas we will not only compete but also read the global
      technology
      market.
